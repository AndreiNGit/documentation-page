                        Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
                        Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
                        Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
                        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. 
                        Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. 
                        Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release." 
                        No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. 
                        With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. 
                        A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source reference implementation. 
                        A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.

                    <h3>What is a Variable in Python?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 
                        In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. 
                        Variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to Declare Re-declare and use a Variable</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let see an example. We will declare variable "a" and print it.
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        a=100 <br>
                        print(a)
                    </code>

                    <p>You can re-declare the variable even after you have declared it once. 
                        Here we have variable initialized to f=0. Later, we re-assign the variable f to value "guru99"
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        # Declare a variable and initialize it <br>
                        f = 0 <br>
                        print(f) <br>
                        # re-declaring the variable works <br>
                        f = 'guru99' <br>
                        print(f)
                    </code>

                    <h3>Concatenate Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's see whether you can concatenate different data types like string and number together. For example, we will concatenate "Guru" with the number "99". 
                        Unlike Java, which concatenates number with string without declaring number as string, Python requires declaring the number as string otherwise it will show a TypeError
                    </p>

                    <code>
                        a="Guru" <br>
                        b = 99 <br>
                        print(a+str(b)) <br>
                    </code>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="flow">
                    <h2 class="header">Control Flow</h2>

                    <p>
                        Often, you need to execute some statements only if some condition holds, or choose statements to execute depending on several mutually exclusive conditions. The Python compound statement if, which uses if, elif, and else clauses, lets you conditionally execute blocks of statements. Hereâ€™s the syntax for the if statement:
                    </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                         if expression:
                            statement(s)
                        elif expression:
                            statement(s)
                        elif expression:
                            statement(s)
                        ...
                        else:
                            statement(s)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="loop">
                    <h2 class="header">Loops</h2>
                    <p>
                        for loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time. Contrast the for statement with the ''while'' loop, used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration, or to repeat a block of code forever.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you've done any programming before, you have undoubtedly come across a for loop or an equivalent to it. Many languages have conditions in the syntax of their for loop, such as a relational expression to determine if the loop is done, and an increment expression to determine the next loop value. In Python this is controlled instead by generating the appropriate sequence. Basically, any object with an iterable method can be used in a for loop. Even strings, despite not having an iterable method - but we'll not get on to that here. Having an iterable method basically means that the data can be presented in list form, where there are multiple values in an orderly fashion. You can define your own iterables by creating an object with next() and iter() methods. This means that you'll rarely be dealing with raw numbers when it comes to for loops in Python - great for just about anyone!

                    <h2 class="header">Functions</h2>
                    <p>
                        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
                        You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
                        A function can return data as a result. 
                        In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            def my_function():
                            print("Hello from a function")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
